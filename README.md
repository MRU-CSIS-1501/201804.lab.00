### INS

| GOAL                                        | REASON                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| log in to INS                               | all assignments will be distributed, developed, run, and submitted on INS; if you have any problems logging in, we need to address them now |
| find the simple reference to Linux commands | there a number of common commands you will need to get and work on your assignments; the reference talks about them                         |
| create a file with Emacs                    | our default editor for this course is Emacs, so you should get a feel for it as soon as possible                                            |
| submit a directory on INS                   | all your assignments will be submitted on INS, this will give you your first taste of how this is done                                      |
| log out of INS                              | if you don't log off properly, things can get...messy                                                                                       |
| know how to access INS from off campus      | chances are you will want to work on assignments off-campus at times                                                                        |

### <span>REPL.IT</span>

| GOAL                     | REASON                                                                                 |

| complete a simple drill  | you will be doing a lot of drills; the sooner you understand how they work, the better |

## Reaching these goals

- [ ] log in to INS
  - Windows Start > INS
  - `login as:` use your mymru username
  - when you type the password, you don't get any indication that things are being typed...this is normal
  - can't get in? Talk to Jordan or Steve.
- [ ] find the simple reference to Linux commands
  - it's available at https://bit.ly/mru-1501-linux-ref - it's actually useful, read it
- [ ] create a file with Emacs
  - make a file called **foo**, put your name in it, save it, and exit: `emacs foo` will help you get started; there's a reference for basic Emacs commands here: https://bit.ly/mru-1501-emacs-ref
- [ ] submit a directory on INS
  - create a directory in your home directory called `my-first-submission`
  - move the foo file you made (well, should have made) into that directory - enter `submit` and then enter reasonable values at the prompts
  - the number of the assignment should be 0
  - when you are asked for the file you want to submit, enter the name of the **directory** you made earlier
- [ ] log out of INS - type `exit` or (cooler, IMO) `Ctrl+D`
- [ ] know how to access INS from off campus
  - Windows how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/putty.setup.guide
  - Mac how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/mac.terminal.setup.guide

---

- [ ] create a REPL.IT account
  - here is our classroom link: https://repl.it/classroom/invite/VRAwbnk - if you don't have a REPLIT account yet, you'll be able to make one
  - after signing up, send me your REPLIT username - if you don't, it's going to be awfully hard for me to give you marks
- [ ] find drills for our course
