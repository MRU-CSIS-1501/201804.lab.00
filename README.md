## Reaching these goals

- [ ] log in to INS
  - Windows Start > INS
  - `login as:` use your mymru username
  - when you type the password, you don't get any indication that things are being typed...this is normal
  - can't get in? Talk to Jordan or Steve.
- [ ] find the simple reference to Linux commands
  - it's available at https://bit.ly/mru-1501-linux-ref - it's actually useful, read it
- [ ] create a file with Emacs
  - make a file called **foo**, put your name in it, save it, and exit: `emacs foo` will help you get started; there's a reference for basic Emacs commands here: https://bit.ly/mru-1501-emacs-ref
- [ ] submit a directory on INS
  - create a directory in your home directory called `my-first-submission`
  - move the `foo` file you made (well, should have made) into that directory - enter `submit` and then enter reasonable values at the prompts
    - the number of the assignment should be 0
    - when you are asked for the file you want to submit, enter the name of the **directory** you made earlier
- [ ] log out of INS - type `exit` or (cooler, IMO) `Ctrl+D`
- [ ] know how to access INS from off campus
  - Windows how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/putty.setup.guide
  - Mac how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/mac.terminal.setup.guide
