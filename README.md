## Reaching these goals

- [ ] log in to INS
	- Windows Start > INS
	- `login as:` use your mymru username
	- when you type the password, you don't get any indication that things are being typed...this is normal
	- can't get in? Talk to Jordan or Steve.
- [ ] find the simple reference to Linux commands
	- it's available at https://bit.ly/mru-1501-linux-ref
	- it's actually useful, read it
- [ ] create a file with Emacs
	- make a file called **foo**, put your name in it, save it, and exit: `emacs foo` will help you get started; there's a reference for basic Emacs commands here: https://bit.ly/mru-1501-emacs-ref
- [ ] submit a directory on INS
	- create a directory in your home directory called `my-first-submission`
	- move the foo file you made (well, should have made) into that directory
	- enter `submit` and then enter reasonable values at the prompts 
	    - the number of the assignment should be 0
	    - when you are asked for the file you want to submit, enter the name of the **directory** you made earlier
- [ ] log out of INS
	- type `exit` or (cooler, IMO) `Ctrl+D`
- [ ] know how to access INS from off campus
	- Windows how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/putty.setup.guide
	- Mac how-to here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/mac.terminal.setup.guide
---
- [ ] create a REPL.IT account
	- here is our classroom link: https://repl.it/classroom/invite/VRAwbnk
	-  if you don't have a REPLIT account yet, you'll be able to make one
	- after signing up, send me your REPLIT username - if you don't, it's going to be awfully hard for me to give you marks
- [ ] find drills for our course
